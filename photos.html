			<h1>Then & Now </h1>

			<div id="thentext">
				<p> Over the past six months, I have changed in so many ways! I created this gallery to display how much I have grown! I also want to share with you more about my best friends and my parents! </p>

				<h2>My Best Friends</h2>
					<p>My friend, Pooh Bear, is an Australian Silky Yorkshire Terrier and only weighs about 15 pounds! The first day I was brought home, I was smaller than him!! My other friend, Bo, is a red nose pit bull, and weighs about 45 pounds. He’s not that tall in general, but now I am taller than him! Bo and Pooh Bear have grown into liking me. At first, they didn’t really enjoy my presence because I was so playful, but now Bo and I will play and run around in the yard together. But I will say that Pooh Bear is a bit old and grumpy. He doesn’t like play with me, but I am finally accepting that.
					</p>


				<h2>Allie and Sam </h2>
					<p>Allie and Sam are the best! We enjoy spending time together. We love being outdoors and making new memories. I remember when Allie used to hold me and pick me up whenever I would eat acorns and leaves. Now, she can’t even really carry me! I also stopped eating acorns because they made my stomach hurt and honestly, they didn’t even taste good. </p>
					<p>Sam is my idol. I look up to him so much! He always tells me what to do and what not to do. Allie is sometimes a pushover and lets me get away with things. I love being told what to do because it helps me learn how to be a good boy. I am so thankful to be apart of this family! </p>

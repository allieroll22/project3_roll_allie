							<h3>First Week Home</h3>

							<p>
								My first week home feels like forever ago! I moved into a new home and became the pet of two great parents. I was nervous, but really excited! I didn’t sleep well at night the first few weeks, but I learned to love this place. I was so small that I slept in a laundry basket. I spent most of my time sleeping and learning to only use the bathroom outside, which was hard because I constantly have to go!

									<h3>Three Months Old</h3>

									<img src="images/jack3_2.jpg" title="jack2"/>
									<p>
										At three months, I had only grown a little bit, but I felt so comfortable with my surroundings. I only weighed about 12 pounds. This began my chewing phase. I learned to love chewing on toys and anything I can get my paws on. My teeth began to hurt and chewing really helps! I finally understood how important it is to wait to use the restroom until I’m outside.

									<h3>Four Months Old</h3>

									<p>
										At four months old, I was house-broken and trained. I learned how to play fetch, sit, rollover, and other really fun training skills. I still only weighed less than 20 pounds, but the vet said that was completely normal. My energy levels were high, and I just wanted to play all the time!

									<h3>Five Months Old</h3>

									<p>
										When I was five months old, I kept growing and growing! My legs grew longer and all I could think about was food! I was old enough to go on walks, which got my energy out while still being super fun. I still love treats and training,  but playing fetch and running in the grass is my favorite thing.

									<p>
										I’m six months old! I feel so tall and I weigh about 30 pounds. Time flies!! I learned how to swim, and I love going on boat rides. Every morning, I walk to a field and play fetch! I am finally experiencing cooler weather, which is nice because summer was so hot!

									<p>
										I can’t believe how quickly I have grown!! I am constantly losing my baby teeth. Last week, I lost 7 and this week I lost 5! The vet says I’m expected to be about 70 pounds! I’m still enjoying being little because I can crawl under the couch and bed for toys, but I’m excited to grow bigger.

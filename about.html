			<p>Hi, I’m Jack! I was born on May 24, 2018, and I lived with my siblings until I was about 8 weeks old. My birth mom is a chocolate lab and my dad is a black lab. Together, they had 7 puppies, and we were a mix of different colors! Our breeders have bred many dogs that became service dogs and many others that are hunting dogs. I think I may be too energetic and playful to be either, but I love learning new tricks and commands.
 	 		At the end of July, I finally moved to Winter Park, FL with my new parents, Allie and Sam. It was hard leaving my siblings, but I can't imagine life without my humans. Allie and Sam named me after their favorite musician, Jack Johnson. I think the name sticks well, and I was so happy because I finally got an official name!
			My life is so great with my parents. They walk me daily, feed me the best food, and play whenever I want. I constantly think about food, bones, treats, and toys! I love to play fetch in the mornings, and I just recently learned how to swim! Allie’s parents have two dogs that are my best friends. It’s always so fun whenever I visit them. We get to go on the boat and explore in the backyard. I’m thankful for my family and friends, and I am always open to meeting new friends and learning new things! </p>
